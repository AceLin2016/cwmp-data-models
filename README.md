The Broadband Forum defines several data models for use with the User Services Platform ([USP](http://usp.technology)) and the CPE WAN Management Protocol ([CWMP](https://www.broadband-forum.org/cwmp)).

USP and CWMP share a single set of data models, but they are used in slightly different ways by the two protocols. For example, only USP supports data model commands and events (CWMP uses objects and parameters to simulate commands and events).
